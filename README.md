# Connor Goes Bananas

I'm currently focusing on building the CMS for this website. Originally I envisioned building CGB out as a traditional content site with the Handlebars template engine. Recently I decided to reorient this project to explore the isomorphic react architecture, which I am currently studying in my spare time.

Stay tuned!
